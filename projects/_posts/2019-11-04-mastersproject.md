Hackers who engage in Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) use multiple systems to flood a network with traffic such as to restrict or shutdown normal network operation. <!-- more -->The result is usually limited or denied access to various resources such as servers, IoT devices networks and applications. Full featured operating Systems (OS) have various tools and resources at their disposal in combating these types of attacks. However, in the IoT world these resources are often limited or not even available.

This project will use open source software tools to evaluate IoT operating systems, networks and devices to gain an understanding as to how susceptible IoT networks are to various types of botnet attacks. It will then make informed recommendations on detection and mitigation solutions.
