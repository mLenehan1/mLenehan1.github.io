 This module focuses on building software development skills using the C language.
 <!-- more -->
 In particular, the module teaches the students how to approach a problem, to devise a computer-solvable solution, to implement it using C programming language and test it. It then introduces the concepts of functional decomposition ("sub-programs"), parameter passing (by value and by reference), structured data types, pointers, and the facilities of the C standard library. Example application areas include numerical analysis and cryptography.
