The aim of this module is to introduce the student to data structures and algorithms, with an emphasis on applications to engineering problem solving.
<!-- more -->
Students will develop an understanding of a range of abstract data types and fundamental sorting and searching algorithms, and gain practical experience in their implementation using high-level programming languages. Students will also encounter a broad range of applied engineering problem areas, as apply to networks, optimisation and statistical analysis, for example. Students will explore and evaluate different approaches to implementing solutions to engineering problems, given requirements for speed and solution accuracy, or constraints such as real-time response, available processing power, or energy consumption.
