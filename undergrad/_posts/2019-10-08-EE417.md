It is performed by set of specific, specialised coders with skills in a variety of protocols, languages and frameworks. This module is intended to provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the underlying issues involved in the development of web applications. The focus is on demonstrating a number of typically (but not exclusively) Java-based technologies and how these systems can be combined to create modern web applications.
