 This module introduces computer architecture through a hardware description language (HDL).
 <!-- more -->
 The course objectives are: to describe, simulate and synthesis of digital building blocks and an entire processor, such as arithmetic circuits, memories, using VHDL; to introduce the design of processors, covering the central concepts such as the fetch-decode-execute cycle, addressing mode and instruction encoding; Starting from a MIPS instruction set architecture, gradually expanding on the details, issues and techniques in modern, high-performance processor designs. Processor performance analysis.
